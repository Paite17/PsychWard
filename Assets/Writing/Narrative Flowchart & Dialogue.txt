The flowcharts are at the top of the page made of sticky notes.

These notes outline every possible direction a player could take and all the associated events
and dialogue options that can occur as a result. This document also outline the key events of each
level which help progress through the day, making sure there are enough key actions for the day to work,
but not quite enough to do ALL the key events, thus encouraging replayability to finish all the questlines.
