  dialogue:
  - '*RATATATA* ''ere comes the new artillery boy!! Just in time, the B-Division
    is about to get the jump on the Netherlands!'
  - HEY!! SHUT UP WILL YER?!!! Noone wants to hear it ya old bag!!
  - There's your fighter spirit Clarkson! Now go get them there mashetteshy whatsit'
    things over there...
  - I swear if I weren't rubbin' backs with the higher ups...
  - Yo! Fresh meat! What happened to ya? Butcher get a hold of ya face flaps?
  - Nah I'm just messin with ya, the only reason you'd be in here is if ya done did
    that to yeself!
  - Name's Mickey, Mickey V. And this here's Dorothy, She's a lil' off to the side
    ya get?
  - Over there's Goggles, he's a lil' quiet type, I wouldn't bother him if I were
    yous.
  - 'As for me? Well I ain''t nothin'' wrong to end up in this insane-o place. '
  - I'm the only sane one here I tells ya! Don't be hearin' those lies the guards'll
    whisper to ya, I think they're all against us.
  - But we'll get outta this forsaken place, we ALLLL will, well, I will. Ya seen
    that stairwell door'n to the left of the cafeteria? That-
  - ON THE WING MAJOR SEARGENT! WATCH YOUR 6 ALPHA TANGO NOVEMBER!!!
  - CAN IT YA NUTCASE!!!
  - Anyhows that stairwell door is the best ticket outta here, but it's locked at
    all times to stop us normal types sneakins and snoopins around.
  - Only thing that'll open it is them fancy keycards them guards is got.
  - What's worse is every stair door needs a different keycard to open which I learnt
    the hard way.
  - Pesky guards caught me like a jackrabbit on a hot plate!
  - I think Goggles here's been tryna craft a lockpickin doohickey or somethin that
    should open a single door.
  - He's got the brains, but i wouldn't look him in the eyes man.
  - Anyhows I'm workin the kitchens down here, they got us on our KNEES scrapin the
    gunk off these tables.
  - But gettin my own bed in the staff room upstairs makes it allllll worth it.
  - 'Speakin of, guards''ll be on me if I don''t get back to work, did I catch ya
    name? '
  - No? I'll call ya Stitchface since ya look like you been cut and sewnm I love
    it!
  - Come and see me Stitch I want you on my team outta this hellhole!
