  - Alright, make it quick.
  - Oh hi Big T! Heh, how's it going? Not one to talk I see I see...
  - It's been uh... tough, without you. This is for the best that you're here now.
  - The kids by the village have been tellin' stories, saying "the Stitchface will
    consume your flesh to add to his collection".
  - Heh, kids right? Sorry. Look, I know it's been a hard couple of weeks, and I
    know everyone has given up but...
  - I know you're still in there. This place will help, you just have to... break
    out of this!
  - I brought some flowers but they uh, didn't let me give them to you.
  - Anyway I can't talk long, but I know you'll be taken care of here. You're going
    to be fine.
  - Alright, time's up here...
